  "summary": "The texts provided are news articles about investments, specifically index funds and a special fund offered by Shinhan Asset Management Company in South Korea.\n\n1. Several news outlets report that Shinhan Asset Management's \"Shinhan America Index Fund\" series exceeded 4,000 billion won (approximately $3.27 billion USD) in assets under management as of the end of last year. The fund consists of two products, \"Shinhan S&P 500 Index Fund\" and \"Shinhan NASDAQ 100 Index Fund,\" which allow investors to choose between hedged (H) or unhedged (UH) versions depending on their investment preferences and currency exchange rate expectations.\n\n2. According to KG Jewel, the total capital inflow into U.S.-listed stock funds was 2,555 billion won ($2.14 billion USD) for the entire year of 2025. Shinhan Asset Management's America Index Fund recorded 2,115 billion won ($1.78 billion USD) in net inflows, ranking first among all operating companies.\n\n3. As of January 2nd, 20XX, the one-year returns for \"Shinhan S&P 500 Index Fund (UH)\" and \"Shinhan NASDAQ 100 Index Fund (UH)\" were 14.63% and 17.15%, respectively, compared to average returns of 13.93% and 16.55% for major S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 ETFs. The total expense ratios (TER) were 0.295% and 0.30% for the index funds, compared to 0.028% and 0.015% for the ETFs.\n\n4. Despite having a slightly higher total expense ratio than ETFs, Shinhan Asset Management's America Index Fund reported better investment performance, with higher annual returns than major S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 ETFs. The company attributes this to their \"precise index tracking ability, efficient operating structure, and cost differences that accumulate over time, resulting in a significant difference in real-world returns.\"\n\n5. Kim Gi-deok, Head of Quant & ETF Asset Management at Shinhan Asset Management, explains that the difference in performance is due to the lower costs associated with index fund trading compared to ETFs, which may incur additional fees such as bid-ask spreads and brokerage commissions during the trading process. Kim emphasizes that even though both funds track the same indices, differences in investment structures can lead to varying returns.\n\n6. Kim states that Shinhan Asset Management's America Index Fund has consistently grown since its introduction in 2023 and has received positive feedback from retirement account and savings-style long-term investors due to its ability to allow for long-term investing without additional trading costs."
